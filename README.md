# embedwave

Google wave was a collaborative tool created by Google in 2009 and it was shut down in 2012. It allowed to share and edit contents with your contacts, including embedding videos from Youtube, but it wasn't allowed to embed from other providers such as Vimeo.

Embedwave was a project that allowed users to do that, it was created in 2010, when I was working in Multimedia Atelier s.r.o, in Prague. This is the code from those days, I'm not really sure if it's an early version or the final one, but it doesn't matter anymore. I just save the code for archaelogical reasons...
